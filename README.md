# UserIdentityCore
Extending and seeding Identity Users and Roles [Learning Project]

In This project I learn To use The builtin Asp.Net Core Identity classes, update the register UI.
Also, find out how to seed the Identity database with sample data,
by externding IdendityUser And IdentityRole and scaffolding the 
Identity account razor pages, at this point you have more control over
what you can add, remove of modify in the UserIdentity account.

Thanks to Medhat Elmasry's youtube tutorial.
